// turn this into a reusable component where it will look and see "what did the user click on (ie. Favorite) and show Favorites". Is that possible? Or maybe have tabs similar to the PC page where they select what they want to view and ONLY that list will be shown for printing/saving/etc UNLESS they select ALL.
// So need state for "Favorite", "OTW", "Collected" from the WishlistMenu comp.
